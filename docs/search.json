    "text": "Introduction\nMachine learning is a dynamic and evolving field that seamlessly bridges mathematics, computing, and real-world challenges. In this blog, I’ll share my approach to predicting house prices using Ridge Regression, a robust linear model. My objective is to demonstrate how machine learning, paired with a deep understanding of data techniques, can uncover practical and actionable insights into complex problems.\nWe began by addressing a fundamental question: Can predicting house prices offer value to various stakeholders? The answer was a resounding yes. A predictive model not only provides an estimation of property values but also highlights the key factors driving those values, offering insights for homeowners, buyers, and policymakers alike.\nTo achieve this, we utilized the publicly available 2023 Property Tax Assessment dataset from Strathcona County. This dataset served as the foundation for our analysis, allowing us to build a predictive model that explores the relationship between property features and their assessed values.\nThis project will show the usefulness of machine learning in solving real-world problems by combining mathematical rigor with computational efficiency. If you’re intrigued by how these principles come together, read on to discover the fascinating process of predicting house prices using Ridge Regression!"

Accurately predicting house prices is not only a mathematical challenge but also has important implications:\n\nEconomic Trends: House prices can reflect broader economic patterns.\n\nTransparency: Accurate predictions promote trust and informed decision-making in the housing market.\n\nAffordability: Understanding price drivers can help address housing affordability issues.\n\nBy applying Ridge Regression, a method grounded in solid mathematical foundations, we sought to explore the relationships between property attributes and their market values."

    "section": "Why Ridge Regression?",
    "text": "Why Ridge Regression?\nIn machine learning, multicollinearity—when features are highly correlated—can lead to unstable predictions. Ridge Regression, a regularized linear regression model, addresses this by adding a penalty term to the loss function, effectively shrinking the coefficients of less significant features.\nFrom a mathematical perspective, Ridge Regression minimizes:\n\\[\\text{Loss} = \\text{RSS} + \\lambda \\sum_{j=1}^{p} \\beta_j^2\\]\nWhere lambda (\\(\\lambda\\)) controls the strength of the penalty term. This helps improve model stability and ensures better generalization to unseen data."

    "section": "Our Approach",
    "text": "Our Approach\nWe followed a Data Science work flow. This is essentail because a workflow provides structure and ensures consistency throughout a project. A clear workflow acts as a roadmap, guiding you through each step systematically, which helps prevent skipping crucial tasks like data cleaning or model evaluation. It improves efficiency by reducing redundant efforts and enables reproducibility, ensuring that results can be validated or replicated by others. A workflow also aligns with the overall goal of the project. It also promotes data integrity by addressing issues like missing values and biases early in the process and facilitates effective decision-making by producing valid and actionable insights\n\n\n\nThis image shows a simplfied form of a Data Science workflow\n\n\nHere’s how we structured our process:\n\n1. Data Validation\nBefore diving into modeling, we validated the dataset to ensure:\n\nCorrect column names and data types.\n\nNo missing values or duplicate records.\n\nNo extreme outliers that could skew results.\n\n\n\n2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)\nUsing tools like Altair, we visualized relationships between features and house prices:\n\nScatter plots showed a strong positive correlation between meters (property size) and assess_2022.\n\nCorrelation matrices highlighted interactions among features, such as a positive relationship between basements and building evaluations.\n\n\n\n3. Preprocessing and Feature Engineering\nWe prepared the data for modeling:\n\nNumerical Features: Standardized using a scaler to ensure uniformity.\n\nCategorical Features: One-hot encoded to convert binary variables into numerical form.\n\nColumn Transformer: Combined preprocessing steps into a single pipeline for streamlined transformation.\n\n\n\n4. Model Training\nWe split the dataset into training (70%) and testing (30%) sets. Using Scikit-learn, we implemented Ridge Regression with a pipeline that combined preprocessing and model training. The sklearn library contains a lot of efficient tools for machine learning and statistical modeling including classification, regression, clustering and dimensionality reduction.\n\n\n5. Model Evaluation\nWe evaluated our model using 5-fold cross-validation to ensure robustness. Metrics like R² (coefficient of determination) helped quantify how well the model explained variance in house prices.Five-fold cross-validation (CV) is a process when all data is randomly split into k folds, in our case k = 5, and then the model is trained on the k − 1 folds, while one fold is left to test a model"

We also predicted prices for 10 new houses with diverse attributes. Here’s what we found:\n\nLarger houses with features like garages and fireplaces had higher predicted values.\n\nA house with 174 square meters, a garage, and a fireplace was valued at $537,035, while a smaller house with no extra features was valued at $212,530.\n\nKey Insight: Property size was the most influential feature, but additional amenities like garages and fireplaces significantly boosted value."
